<p align="justify">This website provides the main methods, references and implementations (in R and python) for managing missing data, whether to impute, estimate or predict. <br>

<p align="justify">If you are a user, you will find the main methods available depending on the nature of your data sets; courses on missing data and pipelines of analyses will help you to determine which method is most suitable for your analysis.<br>
If you are a researcher, you will be able to find datasets and how to simulate missing data, but also find templates to compare your method to existing methods.
