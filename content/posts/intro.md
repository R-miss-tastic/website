<p align="justify">If you are a user, you will find courses on missing data but also the main methods available depending on the nature of your data sets.  A program also allows you to determine which method is most suitable for your analysis.<br>
If you are a researcher, you will be able to find datasets and how to simulate missing data, but also find templates to compare your method to existing methods.
